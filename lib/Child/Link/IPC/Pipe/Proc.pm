=head1 HISTORY

Most of this was part of L<Parrallel::Runner> intended for use in the L<Fennec>
project. Fennec is being broken into multiple parts, this is one such part.

=head1 FENNEC PROJECT

This module is part of the Fennec project. See L<Fennec> for more details.
Fennec is a project to develop an extendable and powerful testing framework.
Together the tools that make up the Fennec framework provide a potent testing
environment.

The tools provided by Fennec are also useful on their own. Sometimes a tool
created for Fennec is useful outside the greater framework. Such tools are
turned into their own projects. This is one such project.

=over 2

=item L<Fennec> - The core framework
